        description: "This project involves implementing a linear regression model using both an analytical and iterative approach (with gradient descent) to predict energy (PE) values based on environmental variables (AT, V, AP, RH). Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (response, y) and one or more independent variables (features, X). This model helps in understanding how environmental factors impact energy production and serves multiple purposes in predictive modeling and data analysis. Key applications include predicting energy output of a plant under various environmental conditions, creating a baseline model to analyze how the input variables affect energy performance, and providing hands-on experience with machine learning techniques like linear regression and gradient descent.",

        description: "In this project, the environment was prepared by installing dependencies such as PySpark and setting up a house price dataset in TSV format. Data preprocessing included cleaning null values, converting categorical columns into one-hot representations, and vectorizing features for use in machine learning models. During model training, Linear Regression was used with cross-validation to adjust hyperparameters like regParam, while Random Forest configurations, such as maxDepth, were tested to improve performance. The models were evaluated using the R2 Score. Additional analysis explored techniques like normalization and dimensionality reduction to enhance performance, along with evaluating the strengths and limitations of the models. This project allows for the prediction of house prices using structured data, leveraging the scalability and power of PySpark to handle large volumes of information",

        description: "This project involves the design and training of a neural network using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains images of clothing items, to classify these images. A feed-forward neural network (with dense layers) is implemented, and Dropout is applied to prevent overfitting. The trained network can classify images of clothing items (such as t-shirts, pants, shoes, etc.), and predict the category of new, unseen images. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed by normalizing the images (values between 0 and 1) for better training efficiency. The architecture includes multiple dense layers with ReLU activation and Dropout to reduce overfitting risk, followed by a softmax output layer to classify images into 10 categories. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function for 10 epochs. Evaluation includes plotting the loss function evolution, generating a confusion matrix to assess model performance on the test dataset, and testing the model on unseen images to check prediction accuracy. The project achieved an accuracy of over 85%, and the confusion matrix shows how well the model classified each category. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep neural networks for classifying images and highlights how techniques like Dropout can improve model performance and reduce overfitting.",

It implements a system that allows users to load images, make inferences, and detect objects using a pre-trained neural network. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is applied to optimize detection results by removing overlapping bounding boxes and keeping the most relevant ones based on an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold. The project includes functions for reading images from a URL or local files, with options to flip images horizontally or convert them to grayscale. Pre-trained models like SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) and Faster R-CNN are used for object detection, offering high efficiency. The system also supports visualizing detection results with bounding boxes using Matplotlib, and includes heatmaps to display areas where objects are detected. Users can customize the process by choosing predefined images and adjusting configurations such as flipping or grayscale conversion. This project enables effective object detection and optimization of results, providing a flexible and powerful tool for image analysis.",

The application also provides live preview functionality, where the captured video is displayed in real-time. The technologies I used for this project include WPF for creating the main interface, WinForms for managing other views such as the capture form, and AForge.Video for handling real-time video. I also used GalaSoft.MvvmLight to implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, separating the view logic from the business logic. The interface includes controls such as VideoSourcePlayer, PictureBox, and buttons like Start Camera, Stop Camera, and Record to interact with the system.",

It includes advanced image processing operations like face detection, thresholding, edge detection using the Canny method, and conversion to the HSV color space. The Kafka cluster is configured using Docker Compose to set up Kafka Broker and Zookeeper, with topics created for image streaming. The Producer captures real-time images from a camera, processes them by detecting faces with pre-trained models such as Haar Cascades or DNN, applies thresholding to highlight specific areas, detects edges using the Canny method, and converts the images to the HSV color space. These processed images are then published to a Kafka topic. The Consumer receives these processed images from Kafka and displays them in a web application, allowing for real-time visualization of the images.",

A Cassandra cluster was set up using Docker Compose with three nodes (cass1, cass2, cass3), where data replication takes place. In the docker-compose.yml file, parameters for each node, including ports and replication strategy, were configured to ensure data distribution across the three nodes. A keyspace named 'proyectocassandra' was created with replication on three nodes, and a table 'teacher' was set up to insert test data. Replication functionality was verified by checking that data inserted into node cass1 was automatically replicated to the other nodes (cass2 and cass3). This setup provided a distributed database environment with Cassandra, ensuring data replication between the nodes worked correctly.",
